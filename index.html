    <h3>Supermans History</h3>
    <p>
        superman is kryptonian.
        kryptonians are very powerfull.
        Superman is born Kal-El on the alien planet Krypton.
        His parents, Jor-El and Lara become aware of Krypton's impending destruction and Jor-El begins constructing a spacecraft to carry Kal-El to Earth. During Krypton's last moments, Jor-El places young Kal-El in the spacecraft and launches it. 
        Jor-El and Lara die as the spacecraft barely escapes Krypton's fate. The explosion transforms planetary debris into kryptonite, a radioactive substance that is lethal to superpowered (as by Earth's yellow sun) Kryptonians.
        The spacecraft lands in the rural United States, where it is found by a passing motorist. 
        Jonathan and Martha Kent adopt Kal-El and name him Clark Kent. 
        As Clark grows up on Earth, he and his adoptive parents discover that he has superhuman powers. 
        The Kents teach Clark to use these powers responsibly to help others and fight crime.
        Clark keeps his powers secret in order to protect his family and friends, who might be endangered by his criminal enemies. 
        In order to use his powers to help humanity, Clark creates the alter ego of Superman. 
        A number of elements are added to each identity to keep them distinct enough to prevent the casual observer from matching them. Superman wears a characteristic red and blue costume with a letter "S" emblem and a cape. 
        Clark Kent takes to wearing glasses, styling his hair differently, changing his body language, significantly altering his voice, and wearing looser clothing and suits that hide his physique.
        Clark Kent moves to Metropolis and takes a job as a reporter at the Daily Planet, where he meets his friends and co-workers, Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen and editor Perry White.

    <h3>What He Does For a Living</h3>
    <p>
        In Metropolis, Superman (as Clark Kent) works as a reporter at the Planet, "a great metropolitan newspaper" which allows him to keep track of ongoing events where he might be of help. 
        Largely working on his own, his identity is easily kept secret.
         He sees his job as a journalist as an extension of his Superman responsibilities, bringing truth to the forefront and fighting for the little man. 
        Fellow reporter Lois Lane became the object of Clark's/Superman's romantic affection. 
        Lois' affection for Superman and her rejection of Clark's clumsy advances have been a recurring theme in Superman comics, television, and movies.
        Various reasons over the decades have been offered for why people haven't suspected Superman and Clark Kent of being one and the same. 
        The most common offered is simply that, despite their physical resemblance, Superman and Clark are perceived as too different in mannerisms and personality to be the same individual. 
        In the 1970s, one suggestion was that the lenses of Clark Kent's glasses (made of Kryptonian materials) constantly amplified a low-level super-hypnosis power, thereby creating the illusion of others viewing Clark Kent as a weak and frailer being; however, this reason was abandoned almost as quickly as it was introduced, since it had various flaws (such as stories where Batman would disguise himself as Clark Kent, among others).
        Another reason given in the late 1980s was the public simply does not know that Superman has a secret identity, considering he does not wear a mask, which implies to most that he has nothing to hide. 
        As an added precaution, Superman would vibrate his face (like Jay Garrick, the Golden-Age Flash), slightly so that photographs would only show his features as a blur, thus preventing the danger of photographs of both identities being reliably compared. 
        However, more recent stories showing Superman being photographed have tended to ignore this factor. 
        The 2004 series Superman: Birthright also explained that Superman's eyes are an unnaturally vivid shade of blue. 
        Clark's glasses diffuse the color and make his eyes appear more human in that identity. 
        A new element that has shown up recently is the fact that most people only know of Clark as a name in a byline, and only see Superman from a distance, if they see him at all. 
        As most people don't spend a lot of time with both Clark Kent and Superman the similar appearance doesn't come up.
        Traditionally, Lois Lane (and sometimes others) would often suspect Superman of truly being Clark Kent (and vice-versa), though more recent comics often feature the general public assuming that Superman doesn't have a secret identity.

    <h3>Supermans fellow heroes</h3>
    <p>
        DC superheroes such as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Martian Manhunter, The Flash, Green Lantern, Aquaman, and Booster Gold are from this universe, and it also contains well-known supervillains such as Lex Luthor, the Joker, Brainiac, Gorilla Grodd, Sinestro, Deathstroke, Cheetah, and Darkseid. 
        In context, the term "DC Universe" usually refers to the main DC continuity.
        The term "DC Multiverse" refers to the collection of all continuities within DC Comics publications. 
        Within the Multiverse, the main DC Universe has gone by many names, but in recent years has been referred to by "Prime Earth" (not to be confused with "Earth Prime") or "Earth 0".
        The main DC Universe, as well as the alternate realities related to it, began as the first shared universe in comic books and were quickly adapted to other media such as film serials or radio dramas. In subsequent decades, the continuity between all of these media became increasingly complex with certain storylines and events designed to simplify or streamline the more confusing aspects of characters' histories.
        The fact that DC Comics characters coexisted in the same world was first established in All Star Comics #3 (1940) where several superheroes (who starred in separate stories in the series up to that point) met each other in a group dubbed the Justice Society of America. 
        Subsequently, the Justice Society was reintroduced as the Justice League of America, which was founded with Major League Baseball's National League and American League as inspiration for the name. 
        The comic book that introduced the Justice League was titled The Brave and the Bold.
        However, the majority of National/DC's publications continued to be written with little regard of maintaining continuity with each other for the first few decades.
        Over the course of its publishing history, DC has introduced different versions of its characters, sometimes presenting them as if the earlier version had never existed, among them the Flash,[2] Green Lantern,[3] and Hawkman,[4] in the late 1950s, with similar powers but different names and personal histories. 
        Similarly, they had characters such as Batman whose early adventures set in the 1940s could not easily be reconciled with stories featuring a still-youthful man in the 1970s. 
        To explain this, they introduced the idea of the Multiverse in Flash #123 (1961) where the Silver Age Flash met his Golden Age counterpart. 
        In addition to allowing the conflicting stories to "co-exist", it allowed the differing versions of characters to meet, and even team up to combat cross-universe threats. 
        The writers gave designations such as "Earth-One", "Earth-Two", and so forth, to certain universes, designations which at times were also used by the characters themselves. 
        Earth-One was the primary world of this publication era.

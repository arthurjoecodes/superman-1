    <h3><em>What He Does For a Living</em></h3>
    <p><em>
        In Metropolis, Superman (as Clark Kent) works as a reporter at the Planet, "a great metropolitan newspaper" which allows him to keep track of ongoing events where he might be of help. 
        Largely working on his own, his identity is easily kept secret.
         He sees his job as a journalist as an extension of his Superman responsibilities, bringing truth to the forefront and fighting for the little man. 
        Fellow reporter Lois Lane became the object of Clark's/Superman's romantic affection. 
        Lois' affection for Superman and her rejection of Clark's clumsy advances have been a recurring theme in Superman comics, television, and movies.
